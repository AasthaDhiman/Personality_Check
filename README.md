###🔍 Personality Prediction Web App (Introvert vs Extrovert)
Built with: Streamlit, Python, Scikit-learn

📌 Project Description:
This web application is designed to predict whether a user is an introvert or extrovert based on their responses to a series of personality-related questions. The app uses a machine learning model trained on psychological traits to classify the user's personality type.

Built using Streamlit, this app provides an intuitive and interactive frontend where users can answer multiple-choice or slider-based questions. After submission, the backend processes the answers and gives a real-time prediction of the user's personality type.
