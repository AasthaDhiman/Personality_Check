# Personality_Check
### 🔍 Personality Prediction Web App (Introvert vs Extrovert)
Built with: Streamlit, Python, Scikit-learn

### 📌 Project Description:
This web application is designed to predict whether a user is an introvert or extrovert based on their responses to a series of personality-related questions. The app uses a machine learning model trained on psychological traits to classify the user's personality type.

Built using Streamlit, this app provides an intuitive and interactive frontend where users can answer multiple-choice or slider-based questions. After submission, the backend processes the answers and gives a real-time prediction of the user's personality type.

### 🚀 Key Features:
A clean and responsive UI built with Streamlit.

Interactive questionnaire designed around personality traits (e.g., social interaction, decision-making, emotional response).

ML Model (like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, or Random Forest) trained on labeled data to classify users as Introvert or Extrovert.

Displays personalized result and explanation after submission.

Optionally shows probability/confidence score of prediction.

### 🧠 How It Works:
User answers a short quiz (~10–15 questions).

Responses are preprocessed and fed into the trained ML model.

The model returns a prediction – Introvert or Extrovert.

The result is displayed instantly along with some basic personality traits or suggestions.
